# Interpolation Project

## 📖 Overview
This project explores **interpolation techniques** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
Interpolation is a method of estimating unknown values between two known values, and is widely used in data science, image processing, and mathematical modeling.  

The notebook demonstrates practical implementations of interpolation methods and provides visualizations to better understand the process.

📊 Example Results
The notebook shows:

Interpolated values between discrete data points

Comparison of different interpolation methods

Visualization of interpolation curves

📌 Future Improvements
Add more interpolation techniques (e.g., spline, polynomial fitting)

Expand with real-world datasets

Provide modular Python scripts alongside the notebook
